This special report tell the story of building my own version of Linux. It contains materials and experiences 
that help other people understand what I have done and provide enough information to help other people build 
their own version if wish. 

Warning: This is not only just a personal project but also a school project. There will be a lot of academic stuff
and things that are very typical “schooled”. However, I encourage you to read them as well, they are good, though. 

1. Why Linux from Scratch
I have been dreamed about building my own version of operating system since I was a little child. Unfortunately, 
due to the lack of knowledge and English language barrier, I haven’t had a chance to do it before, but now I have 
enough skills to actually do it. That’s why I decided to do this project. 
Building your own Linux Version is a great way to learn and understand what go under the system and how Linux distros
are being developed. At the same time, it is also a great way to practice Unix Shell. 

2. Objective of the project
The aim of this project is to build the simplest possible Linux System. The targeted device for this operating system 
is limited resource Embedded Computer. 

3. Materials
There are several materials that provide insight and instructions on making a new Linux Distro. There are two sources
that I learn from. The first one is Linux From Scratch Project http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/ and Second is from 
The Linux Foundation.  

3. Prerequisites
This project is not an easy task. In order to live with it, you first need to be a powerful Unix command line user. 
You need to know how to compile softwares and install them. Also, you need to has knowledge of Operating System, 
Computer Architecture. For safety reason, the system will be built on a virtual machine. Therefore, you need to know 
how to make one. You can also do it on your real computer but if something go wrong,… I don’t know, … you tell me. 
When I was a child I helped a friend asked me to install a new Windows  and he end up cried because I clicked on the 
wrong partition.
